# Command Line Arguments in C: `argc` and `argv`

When writing C programs, it's common to need input from the command line. C provides a way to access command-line arguments through the `argc` and `argv` parameters in the `main` function. This README will explain what `argc` and `argv` are and how to use them effectively.

## What are `argc` and `argv`

- `argc` stands for "argument count" and represents the number of arguments passed to the program from the command line.
- `argv` stands for "argument vector" and is an array of strings (`char*`) where each element is one of the command-line arguments, including the program name itself.

## Usage

The `main` function in C can have the following signature:

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
