## Structures

### Definition

A structure is a user-defined data type that allows you to group variables of different data types under a single name. This grouping makes it easier to manage related data.

```c
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float grade;
};
```

### Declaration

To declare a structure variable, you use the `struct` keyword followed by the structure name:

```c
struct Student student1;
```

### Initialization

Structures can be initialized during declaration using curly braces:

```c
struct Student student1 = {"John", 20, 85.5};
```

### Accessing Members

You can access structure members using the dot (`.`) operator:

```c
printf("Name: %s\n", student1.name);
printf("Age: %d\n", student1.age);
printf("Grade: %.2f\n", student1.grade);
```

## Typedef

Typedef is used to create user-defined data types with a more meaningful name. It improves code readability and simplifies complex data types.

### Usage

```c
typedef unsigned long int ULI; // Typedef for unsigned long int
typedef struct Student Student; // Typedef for the Student structure

ULI number = 123456789;
Student student2;
```

## Examples

Here are some practical examples:

### Example 1: Using Structures

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() {
    struct Point p1 = {10, 20};
    printf("Point coordinates: (%d, %d)\n", p1.x, p1.y);
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Using Typedef

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int hours;
    int minutes;
    int seconds;
} Time;

int main() {
    Time t1 = {10, 30, 45};
    printf("Time: %02d:%02d:%02d\n", t1.hours, t1.minutes, t1.seconds);
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

Structures and typedefs are valuable features in C programming that enable you to create organized data structures and improve code readability. Understanding and using these concepts effectively can make your code more manageable and easier to maintain.
